KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FRONTEND AND BACKEND DEVELOPMENT

Front-end Development:

🌟 Focuses on the user interface (UI).

💻 Runs on the client-side (in the user's browser).

🎨 Involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🖌️ Responsibilities include design, layout, and interactivity.

🛠️ Utilizes frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js for streamlined development.

Back-end Development:

🏢 Manages server-side logic.

🖥️ Operates on the server, handling data and processing requests.

💾 Uses various programming languages and technologies (e.g., Python, Java, Node.js).

🔐 Responsibilities include data storage, security, and business logic.

📦 Works with databases and server technologies.

Key Differences:

🧩 Front-end deals with UI and runs in the browser; back-end handles server-side operations.

🧰 Front-end uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while back-end uses various programming languages.

🎨 Front-end focuses on design and user experience, while back-end manages data and application logic.

🔄 Front-end and back-end communicate through APIs.

Front-end development makes the user interface appealing and interactive

While back-end development manages data and functionality behind the scenes
