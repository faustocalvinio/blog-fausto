- src: This is the main folder where your React app lives.

- components: Think of this like a box of LEGO pieces. It holds small, reusable parts of your app, like building blocks. Inside, you have separate folders for different types of blocks:
Cards: These are special blocks that you can use to create things like information cards.
Buttons: Here, you keep different types of buttons you can use in your app.

- api: This is like a special toolbox where you keep tools for talking to the internet.
Auth.js: It probably has stuff for logging in and keeping your app secure.
Event.js: This could handle things like scheduling events or activities in your app.

- Pages: Imagine this as a storybook with different pages of your app.
HomePage: This page contains all the stuff for your app's main screen.
LoginPage: This is where users can log in to your app.

- contexts: Think of these like invisible helpers that carry messages between different parts of your app.
AuthContext.js: It helps parts of your app know if someone is logged in or not.
EventContext.js: This one helps your app share information about events.

- hooks: These are like shortcuts or tricks to make parts of your app work better.
useAuth.js: It helps with all the stuff related to logging in and out.
useEvent.js: This one makes working with events easier.

- utils: This is your toolbox of handy tools for your app.
HelperFunctions.js: Contains tools for doing all sorts of jobs in your app.
Date.js: It might help you handle dates and times in your app.

- assets: This is where you keep pictures, designs, and styles for your app.
images: Stores the pictures your app uses, like a logo or background.
styles: Holds the rules for how your app should look.

- App.jsx: Imagine this as the main stage where your app comes to life. It decides what to show and how everything should work.

- index.js: This is like the stage manager. It tells your app to get ready and appear on the screen for everyone to see.
